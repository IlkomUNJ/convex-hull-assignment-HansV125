# AI usage
I used Gemini AI mainly to explain the algorithm that is used in the deberg book and also how to find the direction of a point (is it left or right to my current point) in which the AI gave me the formula for orientation determinant which is proven to be useful. other minor earlier usage is how to use QT specific modifiers like QPushButton and QVBoxLayout and QHBoxLayout, basically the QT documentations.

# Collaboration usage
I collaborated with Deric Navino. given that he didn't fully read the assignment text, he initially only worked on the Convex Hull calculation, the one which calculates lower and upper hull first then connects it. While i, only has done the Slow Convex Hull calculation. given the mutual need, we both decided to showcase each other our work and explained how the program and the inner calculations worked and how the hull is built and how the algorithm differs. the point being, our collaboration is focused on filling each other in the understanding of the algorithm we haven't worked on at the time.
